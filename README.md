# Paper Wallet Generator
This web page, written in Javascript, is for generating QRCode's onto a Bitcoin paper wallet. This project is open-source and runs client-side so you can use it offline.

This is built off of wallet art created by bitcoin talk user 75RTUGA and the open-source QRCode.js javascript library.
